Hello, I'm Peter Oost, a freelance software engineer from The Netherlands.
My experience covers multiple platforms and languages (C++, .Net, Java, ...) and I prefer to work with graphics (OpenGL) and artificial intelligence.

Recently I've been experimenting more and more with web development but native development is alive and well.
I believe there is more to mobile devices and web development than replacing old desktop metaphors by cross-browser websites.

If you want to work with me on your project, whether this is an Augmented Reality app or enterprise software, feel free to contact me.
My full résumé is available upon request and please take a look at my [GitHub](https://github.com/Sirrah) and [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/peteroost) pages.
